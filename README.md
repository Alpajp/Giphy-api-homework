# Gif Tastic


Application that uses the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

This is a link to GIPHY API: https://alpajp.github.io/Giphy-api-homework/


How it works:

When you click on a button, the page will display 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When you click one of the still GIPHY images, the gif will animate. If you click the gif again, it should stop playing.

Every gif, displays its title & rating (PG, G, so on).

A form is provided to search for your favorite gif.
